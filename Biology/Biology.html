                                    <li>Lions are unique among cats in that the male can be easily distinguished from the female (lioness) because he possesses a mane of hair. As in most cats, the eyes are adapted for seeing at night when they do a lot of hunting. The claws can be retracted in sheaths to prevent them getting blunted when walking across the savannah, which they can do almost noiselessly on soft pads</li>

                                    <h2 class="major">Why Do Male Lions Have Manes?</h2>
                                    <Article>
                                    <p>"The mane may either serve to shield a male's neck during fights with other males or to indicate the male's ‘quality’. The mane is unlikely to be a shield, as neck wounds are no more common than on other parts of the body nor are neck wounds more likely to be fatal — even in females and maneless sub-adult males. Instead, the mane appears to indicate ‘quality’: males may lose their manes after being seriously injured, and dark-maned males have higher testosterone levels, are more likely to recover from physical injury and their offspring have better survival. Thus, mane length indicates recent fighting success, and mane color conveys information about male aggressiveness and potential reproductive success. Peyton West set out pairs of life-sized toy lions that differed in either mane length or mane color. Males approached the ‘weaker’ member of the pair as indicated by a shorter or lighter mane. In contrast, females were indifferent to mane length, but were much more attracted to dark manes than to blonds.</p>
                                    <p>Variation in a sexually selected trait generally results from the inherent costs of expressing such elaborate physical characteristics so that only the highest-quality males can carry the most exaggerated traits. Infrared thermography revealed that maned male lions suffer greater heat stress than females, and males with darker manes are hotter than males with blond manes. Consistent with these findings, males with darker manes have higher proportions of defective sperm, and eat relatively small meals in hotter weather. These costs are burdens that only superior males can bear; for inferior males, a dark mane would inflict physiological costs that outweighed the reproductive benefits."</p>
