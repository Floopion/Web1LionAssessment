									<p>Lions have long been a prominent animal in movies with many appearances though out time. From Aslaan in the Narnia films, too the documentary `The Last Lions’ By National Geographic which focuses on conservation efforts. Animated Lions have also taken the spotlight within a number of children’s movies such as Alex in Madagascar and the timeless classic “The Lion King”</p>
                                    <h2>'I just can`t wait to be king!'</h2>
                                    <p>With the lion king being one of the most famous Childrrens movies of al time, here are some little known facts abou the movie.</p>
                                    <ul class=ul2>
                                    <li>"The original opening to the film was supposed to be a dialogue-heavy scene. The producers and animators were so impressed with composer Hans Zimmer's score for the “Circle of Life” that they decided to change the beginning to the now iconic opening."</li>
                                    <li>"Disney originally wanted Sean Connery to voice Mufasa."</li>
                                    <li>"When Simba collapses on the cliff, it appears that the pollen that flies off the cliff forms the word "sex," but it was actually "SFX," the abbreviation for the special-effects team that worked on the film."</li>
                                    <li>"Lion King and Pocahontas were in production at the same time. Disney believed that Pocahontas would be the more prestigious and successful of the two films."</li>
                                    <li>"Originally, producers intended to have "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" be a comical duet between Timon and Pumbaa."</li>
                                    <li>“I Just Can't Wait to Be King” was originally written as a song for Mufasa titled “To Be King." It was reworked after they discovered the song didn’t work with James Earl Jones' singing voice."</li>
                                    <li>"It took approximately three years to animate the two-and-a-half-minute wildebeest stampede scene."</li>
                                    <li>"In early script drafts, Scar was not related to Mufasa. However, the writers thought making the two related would be more interesting."</li>
                                    <li>"The movie's plot is loosely based on William Shakespeare's Hamlet."</li>
                                    <li>"Initially, the reason an adult Nala wandered so far from Pride Rock was supposed to be because Scar had banished her for ignoring his romantic advances."</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <br>
