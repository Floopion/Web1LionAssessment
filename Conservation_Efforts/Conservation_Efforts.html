										<p>Lions are susceptible to tick-borne diseases like canine distemper and babesia. Distemper is spread to lions by neighboring village dogs as well as hyenas. Babesia occurs during droughts, when malnourished prey is vulnerable to disease. The ticks spread to the lions after they kill the sick animal. The combination of distemper and babesia causes mass fatalities in lion populations.</p>

                                    <p>"Habitat loss has restricted lions to 10% of their former range, and many of the surviving populations face intense conflicts with rural villagers. Substantial numbers of lions are killed each year in retaliation for livestock depredation and man-eating. Lions are an important trophy species for the sport-hunting industry but have been seriously over-harvested in most countries. There is considerable demand for lion parts in Nigeria and growing concern that lion bones may replace tiger bones in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
                                    <p>Conservation efforts are dwarfed by the lions' enormous range requirements (individuals can disperse >400 km), and the large size of key reserves (for example, Tanzania's Selous Game Reserve is ∼55,000 km2). Lions are well managed in South Africa where the parks and reserves are all fenced, but fencing the national parks in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa seems infeasible. Lions along Namibia's Skeleton Coast and in Zimbabwe's Save Valley Conservancy were rescued from near elimination by intensive conservation efforts, but recovery in Namibia led to renewed conflicts with local people. Intensive efforts to engage pastoralists in lion conservation in Kenya are so far successful, but only protect a few dozen lions; to remain genetically viable, a population should number at least a thousand.</p>
                                    <p>Faced with these trends, the long-term future of the lion is bleak. African countries are reluctant to place restrictions on trophy hunting, human populations continue to grow, wildlife habitat continues to shrink, Chinese influence in Africa is expanding, funding for national parks is shrinking, and the costs of conserving even a single lion are growing. In the long-term, the lion seems doomed to the same fate as the tiger or the panda, except for a few well-protected areas like the Serengeti or Kruger."</p>
                                    <p>The conservation efforts aren`t completley grim though. As this table shows, our efforts have helped slightly increase the population size in the last 5 years. There is alot more work and some rather large hurdles to overcome in the future though.</p>
